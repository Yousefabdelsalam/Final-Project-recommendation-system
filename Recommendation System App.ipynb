    "# 💼 Freelancer Job Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a smart recommendation system for freelancers, designed to suggest the most relevant job postings based on the user's selected skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Key Objectives:\n",
    "- Use Word2Vec embeddings to represent job descriptions in vector space.\n",
    "- Enable users to input their skills through a Streamlit interface.\n",
    "- Recommend jobs that are most similar to the user's skills using cosine similarity.\n",
    "- Visualize recommended job matches and similarity scores interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Technologies Used:\n",
    "- **Gensim** for Word2Vec model\n",
    "- **Streamlit** for interactive web app interface\n",
    "- **Plotly** for dynamic visualizations\n",
    "- **Scikit-learn** for similarity computations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 How It Works:\n",
    "1. Each job description is vectorized using a pre-trained Word2Vec model.\n",
    "2. The user selects skills from a sidebar.\n",
    "3. A mean vector of the selected skills is calculated.\n",
    "4. Cosine similarity is computed between the user vector and all job vectors.\n",
    "5. The top N similar jobs are displayed along with their similarity scores and descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Benefits:\n",
    "- Helps freelancers quickly find jobs tailored to their expertise.\n",
    "- Saves time by narrowing job options based on actual skill matching.\n",
    "- Offers a professional, easy-to-use web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ The system is fully deployed via Streamlit and ready to serve real users!\n"
